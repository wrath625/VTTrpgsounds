# rpgsounds

This module adds sounds to Item rolls in FoundryVTT:

- When 'using' an item causing its information card to appear in chat
- When rolling a to-hit attack roll
- When rolling damage

It comes configured with a list of fallback sounds for damage types, unique weapon types, and spell schools.

Additionally, you can target individual items and override their sound sets.

Finally, you can define a character allowing you to swap between male and female voice sets for casting incantation chants.

_Sounds borrowed from Baldurs Gate 1 & 2, and Neverwinter Nights._
